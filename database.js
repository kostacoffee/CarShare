/*
	Use this file to write the database queries.
	Please stick to the following format:

	global.<functionName> = function(<any input data>){
		var query = "<SQL query>";
		return global.db.many(query);
	}

	For example:
	
	global.getMembers = function() {
	return global.db.many("SELECT email FROM Member")
	};


	For a more indepth look, consider using:
		global.db.one <- expects exactly one row. 
		global.db.none <- expects absolutely nothing.
							If a row is found, the promise
							falls back to 'catch'.
